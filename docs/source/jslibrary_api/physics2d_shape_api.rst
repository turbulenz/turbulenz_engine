Constructor
===========

A Shape object can be constructed with :ref:`Physics2DDevice.createCircleShape <physics2ddevice_createcircle>` and :ref:`Physics2DDevice.createPolygonShape <physics2ddevice_createpolygon>`.

.. _physics2d_shape_parameters:

Constructors for shapes take many common parameters which are listed below ::

     {
        sensor : false,
        material : mat,
        group : 1,
        mask : 0xffffffff,
        userData : null
     }

``sensor`` (Optional)
    If true, shape will perform only collision detection, with no contact points generated. The shape will not physically collide.

    Default value is `false`.

``material`` (Optional)
    The :ref:`Material <physics2d_material>` object to assign to this shape.

    Default value is :ref:`Physics2DDevice.getDefaultMaterial() <physics2ddevice_getdefmat>`.

``group`` (Optional)
    The `group` bitmask for this shape. Two shapes will interact only if `(a.group & b.mask !== 0) && (b.group & a.mask !== 0)`.

    Default value is `1`.

``mask`` (Optional)
    The `mask` bitmask for this shape. Two shapes will interact only if `(a.group & b.mask !== 0) && (b.group & a.mask !== 0)`.

.. index::
    pair: Shape; addEventListener

`addEventListener`
------------------

**Summary**

Add a new event listener for this Shape.

**Syntax** ::

    var success = shape.addEventListener(eventType, handler, mask, isDeterministic);

``eventType``
    One of:

    `'begin'`
        Issued when this shape has begun interacting with another.

    `'end'`
        Issued when this shape has stopped interacting with another. This event is issued even when one of the interacting shapes is removed from the simulation world.

    `'progress'`
        Issued for each simulation step between issue of the `begin` and `end` events for which the interaction is actively occurring, as well as a single issue for the simulation step in which the interaction is deactivated due to objects being put to sleep.

    `'preSolve'`
        A special event type. This event is **not** deferred until the end of a simulation step, and occurs during collision detection for collision type interactions only once contact points have been computed, but before any physics is performed.

        The handler for this event type is permitted only to mutate the :ref:`Arbiter <physics2d_arbiter>` object it is supplied, and this is the only time such mutation is permitted.

        This event is used to set friction and elasticity values on the :ref:`Arbiter <physics2d_arbiter>` manually, as well as being able to ignore collisions for such things as one-way platforms.

``handler``
    Function to be called when event occurs.

    This function is supplied with the :ref:`Arbiter <physics2d_arbiter>` object for the interaction, and the other :ref:`Shape <physics2d_shape>` involved. The function's `this` object will be set as the :ref:`Shape <physics2d_shape>` for which the event was generated.

``mask`` (Optional)
    A bitmask to use to selectively decide what other :ref:`Shape <physics2d_shape>` objects this event should be issued for.

    Default value is `undefined`, which is considered a separate listener instance and semantically has the same behavior as using a mask of `0xffffffff`.

``isDeterministic`` (Optional)
    This parameter is only for use with `preSolve` type events.

    Default value is `false`.

    This parameter should be set to `true` if the handler for the `preSolve` event is a deterministic function.

    A handler is `deterministic`, if its side effects with respect to the :ref:`Arbiter <physics2d_arbiter>` object are not dependent on any external information. The invocation of this function must have the exact same side effects for the same input.

    If a handler is `deterministic`, then Physics2D will permit rigid bodies which are interacting in a non-persistent state to go to sleep, whereas for a non-deterministic handler this cannot be permitted. ::

        function deterministicHandler(arbiter)
        {
            var normal = arbiter.getNormal();
            if (normal[1] > 0)
            {
                arbiter.setAcceptedState(false);
            }
        }

        function nonDeterministicHandler(arbiter)
        {
            if (TurbulenzEngine.time > 1000) // <-- This condition makes handler non-deterministic
            {
                arbiter.setAcceptedState(false);
            }
        }

    In the first case, Physics2D is permitted to put the objects to sleep as it can never be the case that the Arbiter's normal will change, and that side effects of the handler will change as a result.

    In the second case however, Physics2D is not permitted to put the objects to sleep, as we cannot know when `TurblenzEngine.time` will pass 1000 and wake up the objects in an automated way.

    It is in most cases possible to transform a non-deterministic handler, into a set of deterministic ones in a finite state machine. In this example we could transform the logic into: ::

        function Pre1000Handler(arbiter) { }
        function Post1000Handler(arbiter)
        {
            arbiter.setAcceptedState(false);
        }

    And use appropriate calls to `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` when `TurbulenzEngine.time > 1000` becomes `true`, noting that both handlers are now trivially deterministic.

    If the handler always puts the :ref:`Arbiter <physics2d_arbiter>` into a persistent state, then the determinism of the handler is no longer important, but it should still be set as a matter of good practice.


This function will fail and return `false` if the event type was not recognized, or if an existing `(handler, mask)` pair exists for the given event type. We consider an `undefined` mask as being separate from it's semantic equivalent `0xffffffff`.

Example: ::

    function spikesOfDoomHandler(arbiter, otherShape)
    {
        var bodyToRemove = otherShape.body;
        bodyToRemove.world.removeRigidBody(bodyToRemove);
    }

    function oneWayHandler(arbiter, otherShape)
    {
        // May need to reverse direction of normal.
        var flip = (arbiter.shapeA !== this);

        // If object is colliding from below, ignore collision
        if ((arbiter.getNormal()[1] >= 0) !== flip)
        {
            arbiter.setAcceptedState(true);
            arbiter.setPersistentState(true);
        }
    }

    spikeShape.addEventListener('begin', spikesOfDoomHandler, PLAYER_GROUP);
    platformShape.addEventListener('preSolve', oneWayHandler, undefined, true);

As the `begin` event is deferred until the end of the simulation step, it is safe to remove rigid bodies from the world. We make use of the fact that `this` is set to the shape on which the event was defined to choose the player shape which collided with the spikes.

The platform shape is given a `preSolve` event listener, which based on the direction of the contact normal decides to either continue as though nothing happened, or decide to ignore the collision in a persistent state meaning that the handler will no longer be called, and the interaction will be completely ignored until the objects seperate. We take care to reverse the logic depending on the order of the shapes using the knowledge that the :ref:`Arbiter <physics2d_arbiter>` normal will always point from `shapeA` to `shapeB`.

We use a mask of `undefined` (could equally use `0xffffffff`) so that every object will interact via this handler.

As we do not set a persistent state in all cases, it's important we define this handler as `deterministic` (which it is), so that should an object be resting on-top of the platform it will be permitted to go to sleep.

.. index::
    Shape; removeEventListener

    This matrix must not be singular, and for Circles should be such that any circle is transformed into any other circle (No non-equal scaling, or shearing). Circle radius is transformed by querying the determinant of the matrix so that this method will not fail when supplied with an ill-formed matrix.
