What Are the Design Goals of the Turbulenz Engine
=================================================

The main design goals of the Turbulenz Engine are performance, modularity and customizability. Users of the engine should be able to build any kind of game without limitations, in an efficient manner and with an end product that performs optimally when loading and during play.

To achieve this target the Turbulenz team followed these rules when writing code:

**Modularity**

- Users should be able to pick what they want and replace what they don't.
- When possible new functionality should be orthogonal to existing one.

**High performance**

- Strict coding standards to keep code efficient.
- Keep memory allocations to minimum, reuse existing objects or arrays whenever possible, use scratch pads, combine multiple separate objects into a single one.
- Use most efficient storage for each data, Typed Arrays when possible.
- Reduce function calls when possible: write functions that handle arrays of objects instead of loops that make a function call per element, games rarely do a single thing to a single object.
- Be aware of performance differences between browsers.
- Profile often.

**Asynchronous loading**

- No API should block waiting for a response from the server, avoid polling whenever possible, use callbacks or Promises, to notify of data availability.

**Data driven**

- The target should be to make the game a simple dumb player of data, all functionality defined by simple data files.

**Simple well documented file formats**

- Define simple, easy to create asset formats that can trivially be connected to any tool chain.

**Scalability**

- Design interfaces that can be implemented with different level of detail or quality settings in order to scale from mobile to desktops.

**Power without control is nothing**

- Make sure users can do exactly what they want, with a helper layer put on top if required, document performance implications at every level.

**Fault tolerant**

- The engine should keep going even if any type of asset fails to load. The application is able to provide sensible defaults for all asset types making it easier to stay productive and diagnose issues.

**Fast loading**

- Reduce amount of data to be downloaded, compress data efficiently.
- Use the browser cache efficiently, use unique file names based on content and tell the browser to cache forever.

**Maintainability**

- Strict coding standards to keep code readable, easy to maintain and debug.
- Write unit tests, samples and documentation for every new code path.

**Targeted**

- This is a game engine, for games.

Setup Guide
===========

There are two ways to get up and running with the Turbulenz Engine, you can downloaded a packaged fully QA'd
snapshot release from the `Turbulenz Hub <https://hub.turbulenz.com>`__. These installers are available for
Windows, Mac OSX and Linux and will install all the required packages and dependencies to get started,
a full guide can be found at `<http://docs.turbulenz.com/installing.html>`__

*Note: SDK versions prior to 0.26.0 were released under a non open source license.*

If you want to run with the latest version or would like to contribute to the open source project the steps for
getting setup are included below. Use of the open source repository is tested against Windows, Mac OSX and Linux
but may also work on other unix-like operating systems.

Setup
-----

1. Clone the repository `<http://github.com/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine>`__ (or if you wish you can fork the repository
   on GitHub and clone that). To clone the repository maintained by Turbulenz use
   ::

        $ git clone git://github.com/turbulenz/turbulenz_engine.git

2. The Turbulenz Engine submodules the following technology in the external folder

   + tzbuild: https://github.com/turbulenz/turbulenz_build
   + DefinitelyTyped: https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped
   + UglifyJS: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS.git

   Initialize the Git submodules with
   ::

        $ git submodule update --init

3. Check you have the `pre-requisites`_ installed

4. From the cloned repository create a VirtualEnv environment to install the required Python packages and NodeJS,
   allowing you to use all the features of the Turbulenz Engine. Note if Python is not on your shell's path you
   will need to specify the full path for this first command.
   ::

        $ python manage.py env

5. Activate the environment in your shell.
   ::

        $ source env/bin/activate - for bash and similar shells
        > env\scripts\activate.bat - for Windows

6. If you want to move onto the API tutorial section next then your final command is to build the JavaScript sources
   from the TypeScript sources. The next section will detail some of the additional actions you can perform or you
   can move onto `Getting Started With The API`_
   ::

        $ python manage.py jslib

Working With The Open Source Project
------------------------------------

The manage.py script at the top level of the repository provides a set of commands for managing the Engine, the
script should be run as ``python manage.py command`` on Windows but can usually be shortcut to ``./manage.py command``
on unix shells. Running the script with ``--help`` will give a list of commands available, most of these are
described below. All the commands other than the env command expect to have the VirtualEnv environment activated
as described in the setup section.

- **JavaScript Sources** - The Turbulenz Engine source is written in TypeScript. To generate the JavaScript version
  of the engine source run the command
  ::

    $ python manage.py jslib

- **Tools** - The Turbulenz Engine includes a number of Python tools which are installed during the env command.
  In addition the Engine includes a CGFX shader conversion tool which can be built with the following command.
  See the `pre-requisites`_ section for details of required compiler toolchains.
  ::

    $ python manage.py tools

- **Documentation** - The Turbulenz Engine documentation is based on restructured text sources. To build the html
  documentation run the command
  ::

    $ python manage.py docs

- **Samples** - Various samples are included with the Turbulenz Engine. These can be built from their TypeScript
  sources with the command below. This generates a set of html files, JavaScript and asset JSON files which can
  be served with a web server such as the Turbulenz Local Development Server.
  ::

    $ python manage.py samples

- **Applications** - The Turbulenz Engine project includes a few larger applications and some templates for building
  your own application. These can be found in the apps folder, and can be built with the command
  ::

    $ python manage.py apps

  You can also build individual apps by specifying their name e.g.
  ::

    $ python manage.py apps multiworm

- **Command Line Tools** - Various command line tools for processing code and assets are installed as part of the
  virtual environment. These are available at the command line e.g. running ``dae2json`` will execute the dae2json
  tool used to convert Collada assets to a Turbulenz Engine JSON asset format. See the
  `tools <http://docs.turbulenz.com/tools/index.html>`__ section in the documentation for more details on the tools.

- **Local Development Server** - Setting up the environment also includes a locally hosted web server which can be
  used for development of HTML5 games and applications. See the
  `Local Server <https://github.com/turbulenz/turbulenz_local>`__ repository for more details.


Getting Started With The API
============================

To try the Turbulenz APIs requires only a text editor and a browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
Create an HTML file with the following content and place it in the root of the Turbulenz directory::

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Turbulenz - API - Clear Screen Example</title>
        <script src="jslib/debug.js"></script>
        <script src="jslib/webgl/turbulenzengine.js"></script>
        <script src="jslib/webgl/graphicsdevice.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <canvas id="canvas" width="640px" height="480px"/>
        <script>
            TurbulenzEngine = WebGLTurbulenzEngine.create({
                canvas: document.getElementById("canvas")
            });
            var graphicsDevice = TurbulenzEngine.createGraphicsDevice({});

            var bgColor = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0];

            function update() {
                if (graphicsDevice.beginFrame()) {
                    graphicsDevice.clear(bgColor, 1.0);
                    graphicsDevice.endFrame();
                }
            }

            TurbulenzEngine.setInterval(update, 1000 / 60);
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>

After defining a <canvas> element of 640x480 pixels, this code will create the TurbulenzEngine and request the GraphicDevice module.
Using an update function called at a frequency of 60fps, the GraphicsDevice will clear the screen yellow.
To run the example, open the HTML file in your browser.
You should see a yellow rectangle.

To use assets such as images you will need to host a HTML file and assets on a webserver.
Any webserver will work, a quick way to try is to activate the Turbulenz environment in the root of the Turbulenz directory and run::

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

This command will host the contents of the Turbulenz directory on your machine as a webserver.

To demonstrate loading an asset you can try loading an image file and drawing it as a textured sprite using the Draw2D API.
Create another HTML file with the following content and also place it in the root of the Turbulenz directory::

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Turbulenz - API - Textured Sprite Example</title>
        <script src="jslib/debug.js"></script>
        <script src="jslib/webgl/turbulenzengine.js"></script>
        <script src="jslib/webgl/graphicsdevice.js"></script>
        <script src="jslib/draw2d.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <canvas id="canvas" width="640px" height="480px"/>
        <script>
            TurbulenzEngine = WebGLTurbulenzEngine.create({
                canvas: document.getElementById("canvas")
            });
            var graphicsDevice = TurbulenzEngine.createGraphicsDevice({});
            var draw2D = Draw2D.create({
                graphicsDevice: graphicsDevice
            });

            var bgColor = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0];

            var sprite = Draw2DSprite.create({
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                x: graphicsDevice.width / 2,
                y: graphicsDevice.height / 2,
                color: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
                rotation: Math.PI / 4
            });

            var texture = graphicsDevice.createTexture({
                src: "assets/textures/crate.jpg",
                mipmaps: true,
                onload: function (texture)
                {
                    if (texture)
                    {
                        sprite.setTexture(texture);
                        sprite.setTextureRectangle([0, 0, texture.width, texture.height]);
                    }
                }
            });

            var PI2 = Math.PI * 2;
            var rotateAngle = PI2 / 360; // 1 deg per frame

            function update() {

                sprite.rotation += rotateAngle;
                sprite.rotation %= PI2; // Wrap rotation at PI * 2

                if (graphicsDevice.beginFrame()) {
                    graphicsDevice.clear(bgColor, 1.0);

                    draw2D.begin();
                    draw2D.drawSprite(sprite);
                    draw2D.end();

                    graphicsDevice.endFrame();
                }
            }

            TurbulenzEngine.setInterval(update, 1000 / 60);
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>

This time, instead of opening the file in the browser, navigate your browser to *http://127.0.0.1:8000* or *http://localhost:8000* and select the HTML file you created.
You should see a spinning textured box in the middle of a yellow rectangle.

The next step is render a simple textured mesh in 3D.
To do this you will need to build some assets from their source files.
Make sure you have run the *tools* command to build the tools for your platform::

    $ python manage.py tools

*Note: The requirements for building the tools is different per platform. See the* `Pre-Requisites`_ *section.*

For this example you should use the `Protolib <http://docs.turbulenz.com/protolib/protolib_api.html>`__ library, which is ideal for prototyping games using Turbulenz.
You will need these assets::

    - models/duck.dae
    - textures/duck.png
    - textures/default_light.png
    - shaders/shadowmapping.cgfx
    - shaders/zonly.cgfx
    - shaders/forwardrendering.cgfx
    - shaders/forwardrenderingshadows.cgfx
    - shaders/debug.cgfx
    - shaders/font.cgfx
    - shaders/simplesprite.cgfx
    - fonts/opensans-8.fnt
    - fonts/opensans-16.fnt
    - fonts/opensans-32.fnt
    - fonts/opensans-64.fnt
    - fonts/opensans-128.fnt
    - textures/opensans-8_0.png
    - textures/opensans-16_0.png
    - textures/opensans-32_0.png
    - textures/opensans-64_0.png
    - textures/opensans-128_0.png

Copy this text into a file called "deps.yaml" and place it in the root of the Turbulenz directory.
Having built the tools you can now run this command with the Turbulenz environment activated::

    $ python scripts/buildassets.py --root . --assets-path assets

This will build the assets listed in the deps.yaml and output a "staticmax" directory and "mapping_table.json" file containing the processed assets and a mapping to them for the webserver.
When a library tries to request one of these files, it will be able to find it in the staticmax directory.
Now you can create the mesh example HTML file and place it at the root of the Turbulenz directory::

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Turbulenz - API - Textured Mesh Example</title>
        <script>

                    protolib.setCameraPosition(mathDevice.v3Build(0, 1, -2));
                    protolib.setCameraDirection(mathDevice.v3Build(0, 0, 1));

        </script>
    </body>
    </html>

This file is quite similar to the previous examples, but it requires a few more Turbulenz libraries to run.
This time you should see a spinning duck with a yellow texture on a white background and lit by a static point light.
